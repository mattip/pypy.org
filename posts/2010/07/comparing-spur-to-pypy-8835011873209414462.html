      <p>Recently, I've become aware of the <a class="reference external" href="https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/spur/">SPUR project</a> of Microsoft Research and
read some of their papers (the tech report "SPUR: A Trace-Based JIT Compiler
for CIL" is very cool). I found the project to be very interesting and since
their approach is in many ways related to what PyPy is doing, I now want to
compare and contrast the two projects.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-tracing-jit-for-net">
<h2>A Tracing JIT for .NET</h2>
<p>SPUR consist of two parts: On the one hand it is a VM for CIL, the
bytecode of the .NET VM. This VM uses a tracing JIT compiler to compile the
programs it is running to machine code. As opposed to most existing VMs that
have a tracing JIT it does not use an interpreter at all. Instead it
contains various variants of a JIT compiler that produce different versions of
each method. Those are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a <em>profiling JIT</em> which produces code that does lightweight profiling when
running the compiled method</li>
<li>a <em>tracing JIT</em> which produces code that produces a trace when running the
compiled method</li>
<li>a <em>transfer-tail JIT</em> which is used to produce code which is run to get from a
failing guard back to the normal profiling version of a method</li>
<li>an <em>optimizing JIT</em> that actually optimizes traces and turns them into machine code</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="optimizations-done-by-the-optimizing-jit">
<h3>Optimizations Done by the Optimizing JIT</h3>
<p>SPUR's optimizing JIT does a number of powerful optimizations on the traces before it
turns them into machine code. Among them are usual compiler optimizations such
as register allocation, common subexpression elimination, loop invariant code
motion, etc.</p>
<p>It also performs some optimizations that are specific to the tracing context and
are thus not commonly found in "normal" compilers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<em>guard implication</em>: if a guard is implied by an earlier guard, it is removed</li>
<li>
<em>guard strengthening</em>: if there is a sequence of guards that become stronger
and stronger (i.e. each guard implies the previous one), the first guard in
the sequence is replaced by the last one, and all others are removed. This can
greatly reduce the number of guards and is generally safe. It can shift a
guard failure to an earlier point in the trace, but the failure would have
occurred at some point in the trace anyway.</li>
<li>
<em>load/store optimizations</em>: this is an optimization for memory reads/writes.
If several loads from the same memory location occur without writes in
between, all but the first one are removed. Similarly, if a write to a memory
location is performed, this write is delayed as much as possible. If there is
a write to the same location soon afterwards, the first write can be removed.</li>
<li>
<em>escape analysis</em>: for allocations that occur in a loop, the optimizer checks
whether the resulting object escapes the loop. If not, the allocation is moved
before the loop, so that only one object needs to be allocated, instead of one
every loop iteration.</li>
<li>
<em>user-controlled loop unrolling</em>: not exactly an optimization, but an
interesting feature anyway. It is possible to annotate a CIL method with a
special decorator <tt class="docutils literal">[TraceUnfold]</tt> and then the tracing JIT will fully unroll
the loops it contains. This can be useful for loops than are known to run a
small and fixed number of iterations for each call-site.</li>
<li>
<em>user controlled tracing</em>: The user can also control tracing up to a point.
Methods can be annotated with <tt class="docutils literal">[NativeCall]</tt> to tell the tracer to never
trace their execution. Instead they appear as a direct call in the trace.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-javascript-implementation">
<h2>A JavaScript Implementation</h2>
<p>In addition to the tracing JIT I just described, SPUR also contains a JavaScript
implementation for .NET. The approach of this implementation is to translate
JavaScript to CIL bytecode, doing some amount of type inference to detect
variables that have fixed types. All operations where no precise type could be
determined are implemented with calls to a JavaScript runtime system, which does
the necessary type dispatching. The JavaScript runtime is implemented in C#.</p>
<p>The JavaScript implementation and the CLI VM with a tracing JIT sound quite
unrelated at first, but together they amplify each other. The tracing JIT traces
the JavaScript functions that have been translated to CLI bytecode. Since the
JavaScript runtime is in C#, it exists as CLI bytecode too. Thus it can be
inlined into the JavaScript functions by the tracer. This is highly beneficial,
since it exposes the runtime type dispatching of the JavaScript operations to
the optimizations of the tracing JIT. Particularly the common expression
elimination helps the JavaScript code. If a series of operations is performed on
the same object, the operations will all do the same type checks. All but the
type checks of the first operation can be removed by the optimizer.</p>
<div class="section" id="performance-results">
<h3>Performance Results</h3>
<p>The speed results of the combined JavaScript implementation and tracing JIT are
quite impressive. It beats TraceMonkey for most benchmarks in SunSpider (apart
from some string-heavy benchmarks that are quite slow) and can compete with V8
in many of them. However, all this is steady-state performance and it seems
SPUR's compile time is rather bad currently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="further-possibilities">
<h3>Further Possibilities</h3>
<p>A further (so far still hypothetical) advantage of SPUR is that the approach can
optimize cases where execution crosses the border of two different systems. If
somebody wrote an HTML layout engine and a DOM in C# to get a web browser and
integrated it with the JavaScript implementation described above, the tracing
JIT could optimize DOM manipulations performed by JavaScript code as well as
callbacks from the browser into JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Of course the approach SPUR takes to implement JavaScript is completely
generalizable. It should be possible to implement other dynamic languages in the
same way as JavaScript using SPUR. One would have to write a runtime system for
the language in C#, as well as a compiler from the language into CIL bytecode.
Given these two elements, SPUR's tracing JIT compiler would probably do a
reasonable job at optimizing this other language (of course in practise, the
language implementation would need some tweaking and annotations to make it
really fast).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparison-with-pypy">
<h2>Comparison With PyPy</h2>
<p>The goals of PyPy and SPUR are very similar. Both projects want to implement
dynamic languages in an efficient way by using a tracing JIT. Both apply the
tracing JIT "one level down", i.e. the runtime system of the dynamic language is
visible to the tracing JIT. This is the crucial point of the approach of both
projects. Since the runtime system of the dynamic language is visible to the
tracing JIT, the JIT can optimize programs in that dynamic language. It does not
itself need to know about the semantics of the dynamic language. This makes the
tracing JIT usable for a variety of dynamic languages. It also means that the
two halves can be implemented and debugged independently.</p>
<p>In SPUR, C# (or another language that is compilable to CIL) plays the role of
RPython, and CIL is equivalent to the intermediate format that PyPy's
translation toolchain uses. Both formats operate on a similar abstraction level,
they are quite close to C, but still have support for the object system of their
respective language and are garbage-collected.</p>
<p>SPUR supports only a JavaScript implementation so far, which could maybe change in
the future. Thus JavaScript in SPUR corresponds to Python in PyPy, which was the
first dynamic language implemented in PyPy (and is also the reason for PyPy's
existence).</p>
<p>There are obviously also differences between the two projects, although many of
them are only skin-deep. The largest difference is the reliance of SPUR on
compilers on all levels. PyPy takes the opposite approach of using interpreters
almost everywhere. The parts of PyPy that correspond to SPUR's compilers are (I
will use the Python implementation of PyPy as an example):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the <em>JavaScript-to-CIL compiler</em> corresponds to the Python interpreter of PyPy</li>
<li>the <em>profiling JIT</em> corresponds to a part of PyPy's translation toolchain
which adds some profiling support in the process of turning RPython code into
C code,</li>
<li>the <em>tracing JIT</em> corresponds to a special interpreter in the PyPy JIT which
executes an RPython program and produces a trace of the execution</li>
<li>the <em>transfer-tail JIT</em> corresponds to PyPy's <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/06/blackhole-interpreter.html">blackhole interpreter</a>, also
called fallback interpreter</li>
<li>the <em>optimizing JIT</em> corresponds to the optimizers and backends of PyPy's JIT</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="pypy-s-optimizations">
<h3>PyPy's Optimizations</h3>
<p>Comparing the optimizations that the two projects perform, the biggest
difference is that PyPy does "trace stitching" instead of fully supporting trace
trees. The difference between the two concerns what happens when a new trace
gets added to an existing loop. The new trace starts from a guard in the
existing loop that was observed to fail often. Trace stitching means that the
loop is just patched with a jump to the new trace. SPUR instead recompiles the
whole trace tree, which gives the optimizers more opportunities, but also makes
compilation a lot slower. Another difference is that PyPy does not perform
loop-invariant code motion yet.</p>
<p>Many of the remaining optimizations are very similar. PyPy supports guard
implication as well as guard strengthening. It has some load/store
optimizations, but PyPy's alias analysis is quite rudimentary. On the other
hand, PyPy's escape analysis is very powerful. PyPy also has support for the
annotations that SPUR supports, using some decorators in the <tt class="docutils literal">pypy.rlib.jit</tt>
module. User-controlled loop unrolling is performed using the <tt class="docutils literal">unroll_safe</tt>
decorator, tracing of a function can be disabled with the <tt class="docutils literal">dont_look_inside</tt>
decorator.</p>
<p>PyPy has a few more annotations that were not mentioned in the SPUR tech report.
Most importantly, it is possible to declare a function as pure, using the
<tt class="docutils literal">purefunction</tt> decorator. PyPy's optimizers will remove calls to a function
decorated that way if the arguments to the call are all constant. In addition it
is possible to declare instances of classes to be immutable, which means that
field accesses on constant instances can be folded away. Furthermore there is
the promote hint, which is spelled <tt class="docutils literal">x = hint(x, promote=True)</tt>. This will
produce a guard in the trace, to turn <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> into a constant after the guard.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Given the similarity between the projects' goals, it is perhaps not so
surprising to see that PyPy and SPUR have co-evolved and reached many similar
design decisions. It is still very good to see another project that does many
things in the same way as PyPy.</p>

          <p>@Anonymous: I guess you could program stuff in RPython, compile to CIL and get it jitted by SPUR. However, this wouldn't work well for our main RPython programs, which are all interpreters. Using a tracing JIT on an interpreter without doing anything special is not helping much.</p>
